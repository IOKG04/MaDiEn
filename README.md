# MaDiEn

> Maze Display Engine

Part of a [raycasting game](https://github.com/IOKG04/Maze) I'm working on, that I thought would make sense to split off so I can use it for other things too.

Just so no one is confused about the naming, `MaDiEn` is just the first two letters of each of the three words it stands for, and it is pronounced the same as said words (so `medɪɛn` in IPA if I'm not mistaken).
