## MaDiEn tests

These are some tests for MaDiEn.

I will make more as I add more features.

**Chronological order:**
1. lines
2. bold_unbold
3. tictactoe

### bold_unbold

Expected output:  
A `#` which changes whether it's bold or not every time the user presses a key.  
Press `q` to exit.

### lines

Expected output:
```
# # # # # # # # # # 
  # # # # # # # # # 
    # # # # # # # # 
      # # # # # # # 
        # # # # # # 
          # # # # # 
            # # # # 
              # # # 
                # # 
                  # 
```

### tictactoe

Expected output:  
A nice game little game of tictactoe, played with the numpad.  
It should look something like:
```

 X X|OOO|
  X |O O|
 X X|OOO|
 -----------
    |X X|OOO
    | X |O O
    |X X|OOO
 -----------
 X X|   |OOO
  X |   |O O
 X X|   |OOO
```
